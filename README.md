The Picture in Picture project allows users to open and view a secondary video or application window while continuing to work in their main application. This feature is particularly useful for multitasking, enabling users to watch videos, participate in video calls, or monitor live streams without interrupting their primary workflow.

Features:

Multitasking: View multiple screens at once, enhancing productivity and user experience.

Resizable Windows: Adjust the size of the picture-in-picture window according to user preference.

Easy Control: Simple interface to switch between the main application and the picture-in-picture window.
